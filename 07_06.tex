\section{\S 7.6 Conditional Arguments}
\begin{enumerate}
	\begin{statement}{Provided the fetus is a person, a fetus has a right to life. Should a fetus
			have a right to life, it is false that someone has the right to take its
			life. However, if abortions are moral, someone does have the right to
			take the life of a fetus. Consequently, if a fetus is a person, abortions
			are not moral.
		}
		\symbol{A}{The fetus is a person}
		\symbol{B}{fetus has a right to life}
		\symbol{C}{Someone has a right to take the life of a fetus}
		\symbol{D}{Abortions are moral}
		\symbolization{A \implies B, B \implies \neg C, D \implies C,  \therefore A
			\implies \neg D}
	\end{statement}

	\begin{statement}{Lung cancer is not caused by smoking, and this is so for the
			following reasons. Lung cancer is more common among male smokers than among
			female smokers. If smoking were the cause of lung cancer, this would not be
			true. The fact that lung cancer is more common among male smokers implies
			that it is caused by something in the male makeup. But if it is caused by
			this, it is not caused by smoking. }
		\symbol{A}{Lung cancer is caused by smoking}
		\symbol{B}{Lung cancer is more common among male smokers than female smokers}
		\symbol{C}{Lung cancer is caused by something in the male makeup}
		\symbolization{B, A \then \neg B, B \then C, C \then \neg A, \therefore \neg A}
	\end{statement}

	\begin{statement}
		{Some people do not think that the abortion issue turns solely on the
			question of whether the fetus is a person. They would offer the following
			argument: Abortion isn't wrong, since it is wrong only if a fetus has the
			right to use the organs of other persons to stay alive. But (since no one
			has that right) a fetus doesn't have that right either.}
		\symbol{W}{Abortion is wrong}
		\symbol{U}{A fetus has a right to use the organs of another person to stay alive}
		\symbolization{W \then U, \neg U \therefore \neg W}
	\end{statement}

	\begin{statement}
		{If the ventricles transmit two ounces of blood at each beat, then if they
			beat 60 times a minute, then they will transmit over seven pounds of blood
			in a minute. Let us suppose that both these conditions are true. They won't
			transmit seven pounds of blood in a minute unless the veins supply them with
			that much blood. If the blood doesn't circulate, there is no way the veins
			can supply that much blood. From this it is clear that the blood circulates.
		}
		\symbol{V}{Ventricles transmit two ounces of blood at each beat;}
		\symbol{B}{The heart beats 60 times per minute;}

			\neg W \therefore C}
	\end{statement}

	\begin{statement}{If intelligence is wholly hereditary and identical twins have
			the same heredity, then being raised in separate households will not reduce
			the similarity of intelligence between identical twins, but it does reduce
			the similarity. Identical twins have come from a common sperm and egg. This
			last is so if, and only if, the twins have identical heredity. Therefore,
			intelligence is not entirely hereditary.

			(Ask yourself whether if you were to assert the first premise, you would also be
			asserting that being raised in separate households does reduce the similarity
			between identical twins. If your intuition is yes, then the first premise must
			be a conjunction.)}

	\end{statement}

	\begin{statement}{If there are an infinite number of points in a finite line L,
			then if those points have size, L will be infinitely long, and if they do
			not have size, L won't have length. Line L is neither infinitely long nor
			without length. This proves that there are not an infinite number of points
			in L.}
		\symbol{I}{There are an infinite number of points in a finite line}

	\end{statement}

	\begin{statement}{ The following argument is sometimes called â€˜Pascal's wager',
			named after Blaise Pascal, a seventeenth-century French philosopher and
			mathematician: If I believe in God, then if He exists, I gain, and if He
			doesn't, then I don't lose. If, on the other hand, I don't believe in God,
			then if He exists, I lose, and if He doesn't, I don't gain. From this it
			follows that if I believe, I'll either gain or not lose, while if I don't
			believe, I'll either lose or fail to gain.}

	\begin{statement} {If the world is disordered, it cannot be reformed unless a

	\end{statement}

	\begin{statement} { People won't be given bribes if we discourage bribery. But
			unless people are given bribes, cases of bribery won't come before the
			public attention, and people won't know that bribery is wrong unless it
			comes to their attention. Given all this and the moral principle: bribery is
			wrong provided that people know that it is wrong, we can draw the following
			startling conclusion: Bribery is wrong only if we don't discourage it. }
		\symbol{B}{Bribery is wrong}
		\symbol{D}{We discourage bribery}
		\symbol{G}{People will be given bribes}
		\symbol{A}{Cases of bribery will come before the public attention}

	\begin{statement} {George will leave unless Mary doesn't leave. But unless Phil

	\begin{statement} { All high-ranking officers in our present army are
			volunteers. Military coups are engineered by high-ranking officers. Provided
			that both the preceding statements are true, an all-volunteer army would not
			increase the chances of a military takeover. Consequently, the chances of a

	\begin{statement} {It is not the case that there will be both a continuation of PLO raids in Israel
			and peace in the Middle East. The PLO raids on Israel will not continue only if
			Arabs gain autonomy on the West Bank. So there will be no peace in the Middle
			East, since the West Bank Arabs will not gain autonomy.}

	\begin{statement} {Hopes for peace in the Middle East are unrealistic unless Clinton makes a secret
			deal with the Israeli prime minister. Clinton will make a secret deal with the
			Israeli prime minister if and only if he is not as inexperienced in foreign
			affairs as we have been led to believe. Since Clinton is as inexperienced in
			foreign affairs as we have been led to believe, hopes for peace in the Middle
			East are unrealistic.}

	\begin{statement} {The Vietnamese ceasefire will lead to a permanent peace only

	% The problem in each of the following passages is to determine whether or not
	% it contains an argument, and, if so, to reconstruct it. Reconstruction involves
	% distinguishing between premises and conclusion, and, perhaps, supplying miss-
	% ing premises and/or conclusion. Once you have reconstructed an argument,
	% symbolize it in PL.

	\begin{statement}{ â€˜What is not so generally recognized is that there can be no
			way of proving that the existence of a god, such as the God of Christianity,
			is even probable. Yet this also is easily shown. For if the existence of
			such a god were probable, then the proposition that he existed would be an
			empirical hypothesis. And in that case it would be possible to deduce from
			it, and other empirical hypotheses, certain experiential propositions which
			were not deducible from these other hypotheses alone. But in fact this is
			not possible' (A. J. Ayer, Language, Truth, and Logic).}

	\begin{statement}{â€˜As a challenge to theism, the problem of evil has
			traditionally been posed in the form of a dilemma: if God is perfectly
			loving, he must wish to abolish evil; and if he is all-powerful, he must be
			able to abolish evil. But evil exists; therefore, God cannot be both
			omnipotent and perfectly loving' (missing premise) (John Hick, Philosophy of

	\begin{statement} {Background information: suppose you are on the committee
			which has to plan the release of tickets for a big rock concert; you are
			faced with a problem. The problem is that some of your helpers will be out
			of town next week, and the concert is coming up soon; so, if you do not give
			out the tickets until later, there will not be enough lead time before the
			concert. You are then presented with the following valid argument by one ofj
			your helpers: If we have the ticket release next week, we will be
			short-handed for the release. But if we have the release later, people won't
			be happy with us. But in fact, people will be happy with us only if we are
			not short-handed for the release (because they do not want to have to wait
			too long in line). So, people will not be happy with us.}
